# mavros_mallard
This is a custom MAVROS for MallARD. Please refer to [MallARD](https://github.com/EEEManchester/MallARD) repo for installation and use.

## Changes
`joy2thr` package has been removed and `Cmd2mav` node has been moved to [MallARD](https://github.com/EEEManchester/MallARD) repo. Now the thruster control using a joypad is done with the packages of MallARD repo (e.g. [control_nodes](https://github.com/EEEManchester/MallARD/tree/main/control_nodes)).
